To start training we recommend to start it from a new terminal window/Anaconda prompt as this is most stable. 

conda activate decode_env
cd [directory where this notebook is]
python -m decode.neuralfitter.train.live_engine -p notebook_example.yaml



To check training progress you may start a tensorboard instance. Again, please open a new terminal instance and navigate (within the terminal, in a new terminal window/tab) to the directory of this notebook and start tensorboard. Don't forget to activate the conda environment before starting tensorboard.

    cd [directory which containts 'runs', i.e. this notebook's path]
    conda activate decode_env
    tensorboard --samples_per_plugin images=100 --port=6006 --logdir=runs
